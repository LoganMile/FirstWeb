          <h4>Leg Training</h4>
          <p>When it comes to hypertrophy training for the lower body, it's essential to focus on exercises that target the quadriceps,
             hamstrings, and calf muscles.<br> Each muscle group plays a unique role in leg development, and by incorporating exercises that train 
             these muscles at different lengths,<br>
            you can achieve well-rounded leg hypertrophy. Here are some of the best exercises for each muscle group:</p>
            <div class="Leg-Muscle">
              <img src="img/Leg-Muscle.jpg" alt="Leg-Muscles">
              <img src="img/Calf-Muscle.jpg" alt="Calf-Muscle">
              <img src="img/Hamstring.jpg" alt="Hamstrings">
              <p>
                
                <span class="Target-Tissue">Quadriceps (Front of The Thigh):</span><br>
                
                Exercise: Any Squat Movement<br>
                <img src="img/BarbellSquat.jpg" alt="Barbell Squat">
                <img src="img/Hacksquat.jpg" alt="Hacksquat"><br>
                Position: The barbell squat primarily targets the quadriceps in a mid-range position.
                 As you descend into the squat, the quadriceps are stretched or lengthened, and as you ascend, they contract or shorten.
                  However, the <em>best choices</em> (if available to you) are the hacksquat, pendelum squat or belt squat as these machines
                  provide you with extra stability unlike the traditional barbell squat, adding to this aswell these machine are relatively
                  simple to set up for beginnners.<br>
               
                  Exercise: Bulgarian Split Squat<br>
                <img src="img/Split-Squat.jpg" alt="Bulgarian Split Squat"><br>
                Position: The Bulgarian split squat also works the quadriceps in a mid-range position.
                 The front leg is responsible for most of the work and is trained in both lengthened and shortened positions.<br>

                 Exercise: Sissy Squats<br>
                 <img src="img/SissySquat.jpg" alt="Sissy Squats"><br>
                 Position: The sissy squat primarily targets the quadriceps in the lengthened position which makes it an excellent choice for 
                 the quads as they benefit the most from being in a lengthened position. Only downside with this exercise is the stability factor
                 where i'd recommend just using one hand to hold onto something to provide stability.<br>
                 
                 Exercise: Leg Extensions<br>
                 <img src="img/Leg-Extension.jpg" alt="Leg extension"><br>
                 Position: Leg extensions are a solid exercise for the quads in the shortened position and are not limited
                 due to the fact it is a pure isolation exercise making a great choice.<br>

                 These exercises are the only ones you will ever need really for your quadriceps, especially if you have a day of training 
                 just dedicated to your quads, so make sure you have at least 3 of these movements in your selection.<br>
                
                 <span class="Target-Tissue">Hamstrings (Back of The Thigh):</span><br>
                
                Exercise: Romanian Deadlift/SLDL<br>
                <img src="img/RDL.jpg" alt="RDL"><br>
                Position: The Romanian deadlift targets the hamstrings primarily in a lengthened position.
                 As you lower the barbell or dumbbells, your hamstrings are stretched, and as you lift the weight, they contract or shorten.<br>
                 For a Stiff leg deadlift (SLDL), this is also a great option because of the slight extra ROM(Range of Motion) but the difference
                 between these two is just personal preference.<br>
                Exercise: Lying Hamstring Curl<br>
                <img src="img/HamstringCurl.jpg" alt="Hamstring Curl"><br>
                Position: The lying hamstring curl is an effective exercise for targeting the hamstrings. 
                This exercise specifically emphasizes the contraction of the hamstrings in the 
                shortened position and is beneficial for hypertrophy training.<br>
                Exercise: Seated Hamstring Curl<br>
                <img src="img/SeatedHamstring.jpg" alt="Seated Hamstring curl"><br>
                Position: The seated hamstring curl is another effective exercise for targeting the hamstrings. 
                This exercise primarily focuses the lengthened position with great stability because of the seated aspect.<br>
                Again these 3 are all that you will ever need for the hamstrings and if you were to do a full leg day
                (which includes the quads), i'd only include the seated and lying curl then have the RDL/SLDL on a different day
                because it is so taxing on your energy.<br>
                
                <span class="Target-Tissue">Calf (Gastrocnemius And Soleus Muscles):</span><br>
                
                Exercise: Standing Calf Raise<br>
                <img src="img/Standing-CalfRaise.jpg" alt="Standing Cald Raise"><br>
               Position: The standing calf raise primarily targets the calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) in a shortened position.
                 As you rise up onto your toes, your calf muscles contract, emphasizing the muscle's shortening.<br>
                Exercise: Seated Calf Raise<br>
                <img src="img/Seated-CalfRaise.jpg" alt="Seated Calf Raise"><br>
                Position: The seated calf raise targets the calf muscles in a lengthened position. As you lower the weight, 
                your calf muscles are stretched, and as you push the weight up, they contract or shorten.</p>

        <h4>Back Training</h4>
        <p>When it comes to back exercises for hypertrophy,<br> it's crucial to incorporate a variety of movements that target different muscle 
          groups within the back. By focusing on exercises that train the back muscles at various positions—lengthened, shortened, 
          and mid-range—you can ensure comprehensive development.<br>
          Here are some of the best back exercises categorized by the position they target:</p>
          <div class="Back-Anatomy">
            <img src="img/Back-Anat.jpg" alt="Back Anatomy">
            <p>
              <span class="Target-Tissue">Upper Back:</span><br>

              Exercise: Chest-Support T Bar Row<br>
              <img src="img/T-Bar.jpg" alt="T-Bar Row"><br>
              Position: The chest support row is possibly the best row variation because of its stability from the chest support so you aren't limited 
              by your lower back unlike the traditional barbell row. However, not all gyms have this equipment so you can subsitute it with a row on the 
              smith machine, a db chest support row or barbell row.<br>

              Exercise: Lat pull down<br>
              <img src="img/Lat-pulldown.jpg" alt="Lat-pulldown"><br>
              Position: The lat pull down is a solid exercise for the upper back when performed correctly, there is limits with this though because
              as you progress the machines weight will start to weigh more than your bodyweight, this especially is an issue if the knee pads to keep you in place are 
              too small or too big for you. So if there are issues with this or you want variation, you can subsitute this with a weighted pull-up if needed.<br>

             <span class="Target-Tissue">Lats:</span><br>
              Exercise: Single Arm Pull Down<br>
              <img src="img/Single-Arm.jpg" alt="single arm pulldown"><br>
              Position: A effective exercise is the Straight-Arm Pulldown, which targets the latissimus dorsi (lats). 
              As you raise your arms from an overhead position to your sides, your lats are stretched, emphasizing the muscle's lengthened state.
               Although the lats do not benefit from stretch mediated hypertrophy this is still an effective exercise.<br>

              Exercise: Seated Cable Row<br>
              <img src="img/Seated-Cable-row.jpg" alt="Seated Cable Row"><br>
              Position: The seated cable row is a good choice for training the lats and upper back due to the fact the different attachment selection can provide you
              the versatility to train the back in multiple ways.<br>
               
              Exercise: Cable Pullover<br>
              <img src="img/Cable-Pullover.jpg" alt="Cable Pullover"><br>
              Position: The cable pullover is an effective exercise for targeting the back muscles, particularly the latissimus dorsi (lats) and the muscles of the upper back. 
              This exercise can contribute to hypertrophy training and help develop a well-rounded back.<br>

              <span class="Target-Tissue">Lower Back:</span><br>
                For the lower back you wouldn't really need isolation work as they are effectively trained with your RDLS/SLDLs or any movement which requires 
                activation of your posterior chain.<br>
                However, if you would like to you can always opt for back extensions but again theres enough done in your deadlift like movements.
            </p>

       </div>
          <div class="Chest-Box">
            <h4>Chest Training</h4>
            <p>
              <span class="Target-Tissue">Upper Chest:</span><br>
              Exercise: Incline Smith Machine<br>
              <img src="img/Incline-Smith.jpg" alt="Incline-Smith"><br>
              Position: The incline smith machine press is one of the best exercises for the upper because of the constant tension and stability, an even better 
              alternative for this exercise is a converging chest press machine but these are very rare to come. However, if there is no smith machine in your gym
              a incline dumbbell press is a suitable alternative.<br>
              
              Exercise: Upward Chest fly<br>
              <img src="img/Pec-Fly.jpg" alt="Pec-Fly"><br>
              Position: Using a chest fly whether its on cable or a machine is a great exercise for training the chest in the lengthened position and everyone
              will have access to this exercise in a gym as long as theres a cable machine at minimum.<br>

             <span class="Target-Tissue">Mid-Chest:</span><br>
             Exercise: Db Bench Press<br>
             <img src="img/DB-bench.jpg" alt="DB bench"><br>
             Position: The db(dumbbell) bench press is a pec exercise that is in every chest day due to its ability to load the pecs with good stability allowing 
             more natural range of motion.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

             Exercise: Machine Press<br>
             <img src="img/Chest-Press.jpg" alt="chest press machine"><br>
             Position: A standard machine press is a good option for overall chest growth even if it is not converginga s long as you're lengthening/streching the pecs
             it will be a sufficient exercise.<br>

             <span class="Target-Tissue">Lower-Chest:</span><br>
              Exercise: Dips<br>
              <img src="img/Dips.jpg" alt="Dips"><br>
              Position: Dips/Weighted-dips when practiced with good form is a excellent exercise for the lower chest and triceps however as you progress with these 
              and go up in weight shoulder injuries can be common so warm ups would be necessary.<br>

              Exercise: Decline Db Bench<br>
              <img src="img/Decline-bench.png" alt="Decline-bench"><br>
              This demonstration from John Rusin on youtube is a perfect demonstration and we'd recommend watching it.<br>
              Position: The decline db bench is the opposite to the incline, however people tend to set up this exercise incorrectly and put the decline too low
              by putting the bench down. To properly set this up you have to put a small plate (5kg - 10kg) underneath where you sit so when you lay down, you are on a 
              slight decline.<br>
                </p>
                </div>
                <div class="Arm-Box">
                  <h4>Arm Training</h4>
                  <p>
                    <span class="Target-Tissue">Triceps:</span><br>
                    Exercise: Overhead Cable Extension<br>
                    <img src="img/OHCE.jpg" alt="Overhead Cable extension"><br>
                    Position: The overhead cable extension primarily targets the triceps in the lengthened position and is great for putting on size and strength for them.
                    However some people have issues with this exercise because they develop elbow pain because of the overhead position, so you can swap it out for a tricep pushdown instead.<br>
                    
                    Exercise: Cross Body Extensions<br>
                    <img src="img/Crossbody-Exte.jpg" alt="crossbody extension"><br>
                    Position: Cross body extensions are an elite exercise for the triceps, you can do them with one cable or both and put an attachment like a D-handle 
                    on to make it more comfortable. These are the best tricep exercise involving cables in our opinion.<br>

                    Exercise: JM Press/Close Grip Bench<br>
                    <img src="img/Close-Grip.jpg" alt="close grip bench"><br>
                    Position: A close grip bench press or JM press is a top tier exercise for building the triceps, however for beginners we recommend doing
                    the close grip bench as the jm press is a more advanced movement.<br>
                    These are the only exercises you could really need for your triceps but you do have a variety of options to choose from.<br>

                    <span class="Target-Tissue">Shoulders</span><br>
                    <img src="img/ShoulderPress.jpg" alt="shoulder press"><br>
                    Exercise: Db Shoulder Press<br>
                    Position: The shoulder press is excellent for growing that front delt and side delt, to progress through this exercise easier and protect from injury
                    bring your elbows more in front of you instead the side of you. This allows you to press more weight without stressing your shoulder joint further.<br>

                    Exercise: Lateral raise<br>
                    <img src="img/LatRaise.jpg" alt="lat raise"><br>
                    Position: You can do a lot with this exercise as you have the option of going with cables, dumbbells and cables with a cuff attachment.
                      This is a top tier exercise for your shoulders and should be in everyones shoulder routine.<br>
                  
                    <span class="Target-Tissue">Biceps</span><br>
                     Exercise: Db curl<br>
                     <img src="img/Db-Curl.jpg" alt="db curl"><br>
                     Position: The biceps are a simple muscle to train as all the movements are simply a different variation of a curl. The standing bicep curl is 
                     a solid exercise and is all you'll really need for them.<br>

                     Exercise: Hammer curl<br>
                     <img src="img/HammerC.jpg" alt="Hammer curl"><br>
                     Position: A hammer curl is a slight variation of the regular db curl where you just make your palms facing to your body then continue to do a regular curl.
                     Also, this provides a great stimulus for the forearms which makes it a top exercise.<br>
                     Both of these exercises are excellent for the biceps but you can easily swap these two 
                     for other variations which you enjoy more like a preacher curl, cable curl etc.
